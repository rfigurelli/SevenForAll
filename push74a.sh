# SevenForAll — Commit/Push Script under the Principles of Equivalence
#
# Wisdom Turing Machine [WTM] - Commit/Push Script
#
# This script is OPEN and AUDITABLE, demonstrating full transparency
# in every update cycle. All actions, intentions, and transitions are visible.
#
# Usage: ./push74a.sh "symbolic commit message"
#
# Principles:
#  - The update cycle only closes with clear intention (commit message required)
#  - Every commit is listened to before being executed (input validation)
#  - No action occurs without ethical curvature (hesitation before push)
#  - Push is the symbolic closure: union of intention, action, and resonance

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "⚠️  Please provide a commit message (explicit intention)."
  echo "Usage: ./push74a.sh \"your message here\""
  exit 1
fi

# 🟢 Listening: Adding all changes to the equivalence cycle
git add .

# 🟡 Curvature: Committing with explicit symbolic intention
git commit -m "$1"

# 🔵 Closure: Push to the collective circle (main branch)
git push origin main
